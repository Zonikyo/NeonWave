### The source code for the official NeonWave Unblocked Games website
---
 Programmed in HTML, CSS and Javascript. 95% of the code is completely AI Generated, the other 5% is a mix of refining the AI's code and completely organic code.
 Feel free to use this source code for your own websites, as long as proper attribution is given and you do not market the actual code as 'your own' or copyrighted.

#### How it works
The games are drawn from a JSON file, this JSON file includes the Game name, URL, thumbnail, description and categories that it falls under.
The games are then displayed on the homepage and sidebar. When you click on one of the games it opens a game player, which is just an iframe usually connected through a Proxy server to not only increase security in some ways, but also 'dodge' the domain blocks that many schools and workplaces use to restrict content.
The proxy is hosted using Cloudflare workers, which is a service usually not blocked by schools due to the amount of actually educational websites.
